\section{Data quality for machine learning}\label{sec:data_quality}

\Glsxtrfull{abb:dq} is the central focus of this survey.
It is an extremely broad topic, not only in \gls{abb:ml} but also in
data science, data engineering, database management, information systems,
and multiple other adjacent disciplines,
as evidenced by the numerous works on the subject%
~\cite{%
  xuDataQualityMatters2023,%
  guptaDataQualityMachine2021,%
  olsonDataQualityAccuracy2003,%
  mahantiDataQualityDimensions2019,%
  renggliDataQualityDrivenView2021,%
  camachoQualityQualityOut2023,%
  gudivadaDataQualityConsiderations2017%
}
and the equally numerous approaches these works take to study it.
In this section, we explore \gls{abb:dq} for \gls{abb:ml},
with particular focus on the questions of:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item \textit{what is data quality?} (i.e., how it is defined),
  \item \textit{what characterizes a good dataset?} (data quality dimensions), and
  \item \textit{how is data quality ensured?} (existing solutions).
\end{enumerate*}
